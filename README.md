# Typing Speed Calculator

## Aim
The **Typing Speed Calculator** is a Python-based application designed to measure the user's typing speed in words per minute (WPM) and accuracy. The program allows users to practice typing with various sentences and provides real-time feedback on speed and accuracy.

## Features
- **Typing Speed Calculation (WPM)**: Measures how fast the user types in words per minute.
- **Accuracy Feedback**: Compares the user’s input with the sample sentence to calculate accuracy.
- **Multiple Practice Sentences**: Allows users to select different sentences from a dropdown menu to practice.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Easy-to-use graphical interface built with `Tkinter`.
- **Real-Time Feedback**: Displays WPM and accuracy feedback along with encouraging messages.
- **Reset Button**: Users can reset the test and start a new one without restarting the application.

## Technologies Used
- **Python**: Main programming language for developing the application.
- **Tkinter**: Python’s built-in library for creating the GUI.

## How to Use
1. **Run the Application**:
   - Save the code in a file named `typing_speed_calculator.py`.
   - Run it using Python:
     ```bash
     python typing_speed_calculator.py
     ```

2. **Choose a Sentence**:
   - Use the dropdown menu to select a sentence to practice typing.

3. **Start Typing**:
   - Begin typing in the text input box. The timer starts as soon as you press a key.
   
4. **Calculate Typing Speed**:
   - After completing the sentence, click the **"Calculate WPM"** button. The app will display your WPM (words per minute) and your accuracy percentage.

5. **Reset**:
   - Click the **"Reset"** button to clear the text entry field and start a new test with the same or a different sentence.

## Installation
1. Ensure you have Python installed on your system.
2. Install the necessary dependency (`Tkinter` is included by default with Python, so no external libraries are needed):
   ```bash
   pip install tk
